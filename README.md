### Self-supervised Representation Learning from Videos for Facial Action Unit Detection, CVPR 2019 (oral)

We propose a Twin-Cycle Autoencoder (TCAE) that self-supervisedly learns two embeddings to encode the movements of AUs and head motions.
<br />Given a source and target facial images, TCAE is tasked to change the AUs or head poses of the source frame to those of the target frame by predicting the AU-related and pose-related movements, respectively.
